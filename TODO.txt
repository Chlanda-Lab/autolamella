TODO
- [ ] put the protocol settings in the log as a text file

- [ ] make different masks for the fiducial alignment (one circular for the original, one rectangular)

- [ ] locate_feature & align images should have input images passed in IN THE OTHER ORDER! Then we won't be weird in x.
The x beam shift is going in the wrong direction currently.
The y beam shift is correct. Fix this!

- [ ] Re-code Alex's tie-breaker function for situations where 
In the case where there are multiple maxima found by the register translation function

- [ ] SAVE all the output, and LOG all the output. Everything goes to the logfile. Save all images (especially cross correlation images)

- We can't use a weird scan direction. Check with GG that he's not using some strange scan?

Alex says the option for a bandpass filter is very important & cannot be compromised.
Allow some option for the user to specify bandpass inputs in the yaml file.
Alex says we don't need subpixel accuracy, so leave it out for now.
